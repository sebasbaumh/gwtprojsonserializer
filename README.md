# GWT Professional JSON Serializer
JSON Serializer/Deserializer for GWT using code generators (fork of [Google Code Project](https://code.google.com/archive/p/gwtprojsonserializer/))

GWT Professional JSON Serializer is a free, open source library that allows you to serialize any JSON text into a java object (and reverse). It is crucial functionality when there is no GWT-RPC on server side. This JSON serializer allows easy connecting GWT client side to any standard server side technology.
All Java classes in your project which are marked just by implementing JsonSerializable interface are put into JSON serialization context.
